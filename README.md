# The bioconda channel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/galaxyproject/conda-iuc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/galaxyproject/conda-iuc)

[Conda](http://anaconda.org) is a platform- and language-independent package
manager that sports easy distribution, installation and version management of
software.  The [IUC channel](https://anaconda.org/iuc) is a Conda
channel providing bioinformatics related packages.  This repository hosts the
corresponding recipes.

The IUC highly recommends to submit packages to the [bioconda project](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) which will be used by Galaxy in it's standard configuration.

This repository will contain IUC conda packages that are migrated from traditional Galaxy tool dependencies or
packages that can not be submitted to the bioconda project.

Test Change.
